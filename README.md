# Bamazon 

Welcome to Bamazon! We are glad to see you shopping with us today! 
Bamazon is a command line application that uses node and sql to provide an archaic shopping experience

![Bamazon](https://github.com/LtWilhelm/bamazon/blob/master/img/bamazonCustomer.png?raw=true)

Bamazon makes use of an unintuitive menu system to allow less than simple shop interaction. Running bamazonCustomer.js with node let's you into the shop where you will immediately be asked to by things (because why else would you be here?)

Simply select your choice from the menu, and then enter in the amount you would like. Then from there, you most likely won't get anything and then be asked to pay. You can pay with PaySmell. Or not. I'm not gonna make any money off of this anyway.
